# atypicalShop

A refactor example of an existing site -> [Atypical](https://www.atypical.it/).

This project has been developed during my 2nd year at the univeristy. 

The website make use of some nice plug-in:

[Aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) & [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

I have also used the embedded [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/free-trial?term=shopify&Network=Search&SiteTarget=&mt=e&adid=328328049569&adpos=1t1&CampaignId=1681994799&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwwtTmBRBqEiwA-b6c_3UF3j-HxTr_ERCPDq5aJkNPUrAUtPGlSijPthjJ_jvHouIJZCO2XhoCgXgQAvD_BwE) feature.
